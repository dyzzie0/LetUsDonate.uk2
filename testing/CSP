{/* Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

This page does not have a Content Security Policy (CSP) header set. 
A CSP helps to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load. Without a CSP, the application is more vulnerable to these types of attacks.

Solution:
To fix this issue, we set a Content Security Policy header in our server configuration. 

 headers: {
      "Content-Security-Policy": `
        default-src 'self';
        script-src 'self';
        style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
        img-src 'self' data: http://localhost:8000/storage/;
        connect-src 'self' http://localhost:8000;
        font-src 'self';
      `.replace(/\n/g, ' '), 
    },

Zap identified that the application lacked a Content Security Policy (CSP) header, leaving it vulnerable to XSS and other injection attacks. 
To fix this, CSP headers were added to the React frontend via vite.config.js and to the PHP backend through middleware.
The headers restrict allowed sources for scripts, styles, images, fonts, and API requests to trusted domains only.
After implementing this change, ZAP confirmed that the CSP issue was resolved, ensuring improved security for both frontend and backend content.

The zap test went from: 10 to 9 after this test
