{/*Cross-Domain Misconfiguration

We had an example of a Cross-Domain Misconfiguration (CDM) vulnerability in our application. 
This occurs when CORS settings are improperly configured, allowing unauthorized domains to access resources.

To fix this, we updated the backend CORS configuration to explicitly define allowed HTTP methods, origins, and headers:

'allowed_methods' => ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
'allowed_origins' => ['http://localhost:5173', 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'],
'allowed_headers' => ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With'],

This ensures that only specified domains and methods can interact with our API, 
enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access. 

The zap test remained at 2 which is something that can be improved upon in the future
