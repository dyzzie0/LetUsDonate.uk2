{/* Missing Anti-Clickjacking Header

ZAP flagged that the application did not set the X-Frame-Options header, 
leaving it vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. Without this header, attackers 
can embed the site in a malicious iframe to trick users into performing unintended actions.

We created a middleware in the PHP backend that adds 
the X-Frame-Options header to all HTTP responses. The header instructs browsers 
not to allow the page to be displayed in frames from other domains.

// app/Http/Middleware/PreventClickjacking.php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class PreventClickjacking
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $response = $next($request);
        $response->headers->set('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
        return $response;
    }
}

// Register middleware globally in app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $middleware = [
    // other middleware...
    \App\Http\Middleware\PreventClickjacking::class,
];

After implementing this middleware, all pages include the X-Frame-Options: DENY header, 
preventing the site from being embedded in iframes on external sites and mitigating 
the risk of clickjacking attacks.

The zap test went from: 9 to 1 alert after this fix
